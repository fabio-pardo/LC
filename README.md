LC APP - https://lc-app-fabio.herokuapp.com/

I made this MERN stack app to better track my leetcode questions. As most software engineers study for technical interviews with leetcode, we often times submit the correct code snippet into leetcode to just get that passing status on that question. 

I normally study leetcode with paper and pencil and write a check mark or an X mark at the top of my page to signify if I ACTUALLY passed it or not. So that I can at some point in the future retry that very question I failed to see if I've gathered the skill to pass that question on my first try. 

My binder, where I store my question papers, was getting pretty full and so I decided to create this app. 

I used https://github.com/fishercoder1534/Leetcode README.md file to scrap all of the algorithmic questions and insert them into my database to have solutions and other information about the questions. When you submit a question, you determine if you passed or failed it and my backend does all the work in figuring out the link where you can retry the question again in leetcode, it's title, the questions difficulty, and also providing you a link to the solution (in Java). 

This app is quaint and simple but it gets the job done :).
